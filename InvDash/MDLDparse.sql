--Remove problem chars--
Open MDLD in notepad++
put line break in on the first line after ' %SAPWIN%PLS200Xl8.5;Oa1 '
type 'lines' on the 2nd line and then new line
Ctrl+F   [^a-zA-Z0â€“9#-_\s]   replace with '#'
this replaces '|' with '#'
once replaced, use '|'as the separator to ensure the lines are not split

--in shell--to test--
cd ~/RM06analyst/MDLDparse
rm test.db;sqlite3 test.db ".read MDLDparse.sql";DBbrowser test.db&

  '\01' is the Start of Header character. Its a good column separator
because its not present anywhere in the source report, thus every line is
just 1 column
