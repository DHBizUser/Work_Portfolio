üëã Hello! üòÅ Thanks for checking out my work.

I practice business and data analysis in various settings. I currently
work for a contract manufacturer of personal care and pharmaceutical
products as a Supply Chain Analyst.  This repository showcases a few
specific artifacts to share methods with other people doing similar
things. I am self-taught, and I invite opportunities to learn from
others that come across this work.

*BOMreportConvPaths* -- Home grown solution to CS15 for multiple
materials in SAP.  It takes a flat list of parent-component pairs off
of a set of Bills of Materials and evaluates all the possible complete
usage paths. Useful for getting all the components associated with a
customer or product group.


*MRPsummary* -- Highlights current and upcoming inventory constraints
by computing run out dates, pathwise by customer. I join Material
Resource Planning data with context from BOMreportConvPaths and drop
it into an Excel pivot table.


*ResumeCV* -- Everything needed to compile my resume PDF document from
LaTeX source.  This is my working copy, I make adjustments to the tex
source and distribute variations of this.  I've found this preferable
to fiddling with many copies of a MS Word document.  A variation of
[[https://github.com/jankapunkt/latexcv][Jan K√ºster's work]].
