üëã Hello! üòÅ Thanks for checking out my work.

I practice business and data analysis in various roles personal and
professional. I currently work for a contract manufacturer of personal
care and pharmaceutical products as a Supply Chain Analyst.  This
repository showcases a few specific artifacts to share methods with
other people doing similar things in personal, academic, or
professional settings. I am self-taught, and I invite opportunities to
learn from others that come across this work.

*BOMreportConvPaths* -- For those familiar with SAP inventory system,
this is my home grown solution to CS15 for multiple materials.  It
takes a flat list of parent-component pairs off of a set of Bills of
Materials and evaluates all the possible complete usage paths. This is
used for getting all the components associated with a customer or
product group.


*MRPsummary* -- This highlights current and upcoming inventory constraints
by computing run out dates, pathwise by customer. I join Material
Resource Planning data with context from BOMreportConvPaths and drop
it into an Excel pivot table (not included here).


*ResumeCV* -- This is everything needed to compile my resume PDF document from
LaTeX source.  This is my working copy.  I make adjustments to the tex
source and distribute variations of this.  I've found this preferable
to fiddling with many copies of a MS Word document.  The graphics are
designed myself using Inkscape and exported to pdf.
