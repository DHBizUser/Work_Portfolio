Hello! Thanks for checking out my work.

I've developed my business and data analysis practice during my time
in various roles, as a survival skill of sorts. I currently work for a
contract manufacturer of personal care and pharmaceutical products as
a Supply Chain Analyst.  This repository showcases a few specific
artifacts to share methods with other people doing similar things in
personal, academic, or professional settings. It's all been a fairly
autodidactic pursuit since I graduated university in 2015, so I invite
opportunities to learn from others that come across this work. It is
not intended to function as standalone software or to publish
findings.  The data these artifacts are used with are not for public
consumption.
