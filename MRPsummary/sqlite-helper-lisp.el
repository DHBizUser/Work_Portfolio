;; A program to handle text pre-processing out of SAP and put it through sqlite3 CLI

;; should be icing for the sqlite3 CLI cake, not too deeply embedded using database functions
;; see:  (info "(elisp)database")   <-- I prefer calling the CLI through a shell over using those elisp functions
;; SQL is a more widely used lang than emacs lisp. The CLI allows the SQL parts to stand on their own.

;; Copilot prompt: 
;; write an emacs lisp function that replaces the values in a plist with the values in a new plist
